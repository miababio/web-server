                                    NOTES
                                    -----
                                    
Hello Express.js (Using 4.13.2, latest is 4.14.0)
    - Popular npm module
    - Helps create web servers and HTTP requests easily
    - Small example to display "Hello Express!" to people who visit the page
    
    - var express = require("express");
      var app = express();

      app.get("/", function(req, res) {
          res.send("Hello Express!");
      });
      app.listen(3000);
      
        - var app = express(); -> initializes Express
        - app.get(<root URL>, <anonymous function>(req, res) { 
            // response code goes in here
          });
            - get -> REST method; All webpages behind the scenes use a GET method to obtain/display the website info
            - first part is root url, could be a help page (/help), an about page (/about), etc
            - req -> request, contains the info (url, json passed, cookies, etc)
            - res -> response, response you want to send back
        - app.listen(<port_number>) -> Port you want the server to listen in on
        - to see the results, open up a web browser and type "localhost:<port_number you're listening on>
    - The whole app.get() method is called a Route
                                             -----
    - Challenge - add an "About" route
        - See Example 1
        
Setting Up Static Websites
    - When designing sites, most of the time you'll have folders that people can access to see the page
        - Ex: "public" folder which contains index.html, etc.
    - We need to tell Express to "expose" those folders so that we can access them
    - use the use() method
        - Ex: app.use(express.static(<full path to your folder>));
        - Problem is that you have to pass in the absolute path-it doesn't do relative paths!
        - folder paths can be long!
            - Solution: NodeJS has a "__dirname" keyword that returns the absolute path of the folder
            - doing it on this folder right now gets me:
                - C:\Users\moa003\Desktop\The Complete Node JS Developer Course\5 - Creating A Web Server
    - So the final line would be -> app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/public"));
        - once added, you can just navigate to "localhost:3000/index.html"
        - You can also call it implicitly (since its a default page) "localhost:3000"
        
Middleware is Awesome (Express Middleware)
    - Middleware -> let's you run some, or all of your routes
        - Application-level Middleware - runs for every route 
        - Route-level Middleware - runs only on the ones you specify
        - See Example 2 (Application Middleware)
            - Since the body of requireAuthentication is going to be fun first, before the "/about" and whatnot below, the "next" parameter tells Express to move on
                - Ex: if a user is already logged in, you can call "next" and then run the route's specific function. If you don't, you can throw an error and prevent the user from accessing the privat e information.
            - Add middleware to the app using app.use() (see below)
                - ORDER MATTERS! If you put that app.use() call below the "/about" route, it would never run
                    - Make sure your middleware stuff is at the top
            - When using app.use, you're using Application Middleware!
                - It's going to be called for every page requested, and every route hit (console.log msg in this case)
        - You can add middleware to specific routes as well (Route-Level Middleware)
            - Has to be the second argument
            
            - Ex: var middleware = {
                     requireAuthentication: function(req, res, next) {
                     console.log("Private route hit!");
                     next();
                  };
                  app.get("/about", middleware.requireAuthentication, function(req, res) {
                     res.send("About Us");
                  });
                  
        - Another Middleware example
            - See Example 3
                - you can use "req.method" to show you the the of request being requested, and "req.originalUrl" to display the url of where the request comes from
                    - Note: refresh the page, you get "GET /"; if you do a hard reset in Chrome (Ctrl+Shift+R), you get
                        - "GET /"
                        - "GET /favicon.ico"
                    - These two get everything needed to produce the page. favicon is the little icon used next to your tab
                
Using Git
    - Form of version control
    - Settings used:
        - git config --global user.name "Michael Ababio"
        - git config --global user.email "miababio@gmail.com"
        - git config --global push.default matching
        - git config --global alias.co checkout
    - To create a repository in the folder:
        - "git init"
    - Check the status of your files
        - "git status"
    - To add files to git
        - "git add ."
        - Uh oh! This adds EVERY file in the folder, including subfolders!
            - It added all the extra stuff in node_modules we dont need committed!
        - To revert the adding of files, use:
            "git rm --cached -r <file/folder you want removed from cache>"
            - Removes it from the cache
            - There's no need to keep it, since we can download all the dependencies we need whenever we want
        - .gitignore
            - Changes in files/folders that you want git to.....ignore
        - To commit all files (that git knows about), and with a commit message:
            - git commit -a -m "<message>"
    - Using git makes it easier to deploy files, etc.
    

Generate SSH, Join Heroku & GitHub
    - Need to do some tedious tasks initially
    - Generate SSH -> Helps us validate our files/information for places like Heroku and GitHub
    - GitHub - Place to hold code/work with others
    - Heroku - Place to deploy our apps on the web
    - Need to generate SSH keys to link your ocmputer with GitHub and Heroku
    - To check if you already have keys generated on your computer:
        - "ls -al ~/.ssh"
        - Will display some files; If you have "id_rsa" and "id_rsa.pub" then you have generated keys
    - If not, generate some ssh keys by typing the following in Git Bash:
        - "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<email you're most likey to use"
            - Will ask you questions (rename files, passphrase, etc. can leave blank)
            - This generates a new public/private RSA key pair
            - will be located in your .ssh folder (id_rsa, id_rsa.pub)
    - GitHub/Heroku
        - Navigate to where you can add SSH keys
        - Copy and paste from the id_rsa.pub file
            - NOTE: You should NEVER sshow the private key, ANYWHERE. Only use the PUBLIC (.pub) key
            - If you lose the private key, or the keys become inactive after a while, generate new ones
    - GitHub
        - After adding keys, add the repository
        - Click the green "Add A Repository" button on the right
            - Give it a name (ex: web-server)
            - Since we have an exisitng repo (on our computer), we just have to push it to github
                - "git remote add origin <git@github.com:whatever ssh link it gives you>"
                - "git push -u origin master"
            - Can check that it worked by doing:
                - "git remote" // displays origin 
                           OR
                - "git remote -v" // displays remote URL commands (v = verbose)
            - Fetch = getting, push = saving
            
            
Deploying your Application
    - "heroku create" in project directory in cmd -> Creates a Heroku app just like that!
        - Generates a link to your newly created app
    - You can run "heroku open" after to view your new app
    - Push code to heroku so it can be deployed to the web
        - When we did "heroku create", it added a fetch and push command to a remote repo in Heroku
            - Same concept as pushing to the remote repo in GitHub, just with heroku
            - You can see this if you do "git remote -v"
        - Heroku comes with its own port environment, so in server.js, we change the line to
            - var PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
                - if the port environment exists, that's what it'll be, else it'll be 3000 (which happens on our local computers)
        - Push to Heroku -> "git push heroku <branch>"
            - In this case: "git push heroku master"
        - Your code is now live on the web after pushing to Heroku (yay!)
    - If you do "heroku open" again, or refresh the page if you still have it, you see it runs our web-server code!
        - https://vast-eyrie-19420.herokuapp.com/ is the site
        - Actually running on the web! Not on localhost anymore :)
    - Can rename App urls:
        - heroku rename <new name>
            - has naming conventions...look later
            - This helps when distinguishing apps
    
        

                                  Examples
                                  --------
                            
Example 1 - Challenge -> Add an "About" route
---------
var express = require("express");
var app = express();

app.get("/about", function(req, res) {
    res.send("About Us");
});

app.listen(3000); //listen to a port

- Access result by opening "localhost:3000/about"


Example 2 - Application Middleware Example
---------
var express = require("express");
var app = express();
var PORT = 3000;

var middleware = {
    requireAuthentication: function(req, res, next) {
        console.log("Private route hit!");
        next();
    }
};

app.use(middleware.requireAuthentication);

app.get("/about", function(req, res) {
    res.send("About Us");
});

app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/public"));

app.listen(PORT, function() {
    console.log("Express server started on port " + PORT + "!");
});

In Chrome -> "localhost:3000", + the other pages to see "Private route hit!" in the console


Example 3 - Another Middleware Example (logger)
---------
var express = require("express");
var app = express();
var PORT = 3000;

var middleware = {
    requireAuthentication: function(req, res, next) {
        console.log("Private route hit!");
        next();
    },
    logger: function(req, res, next) {
        console.log(req.method + " " + req.originalUrl);
        next();
    } 
};

app.use(middleware.logger);

app.get("/about", middleware.requireAuthentication, function(req, res) {
    res.send("About Us");
});

app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/public"));

app.listen(PORT, function() {
    console.log("Express server started on port " + PORT + "!");
});
